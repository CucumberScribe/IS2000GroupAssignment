        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Peter Dadson Jr, but I much prefer to be called PJ. I am an Australian that has come to the United States to pursue my basketball endeavors, and also study and hopefully earn a bachelors degree. I am currently a junior academically (In my 3rd year of studies), and I am majoring in cyber security. Once graduated, I intend to pursue a professional career in basketball. After I have retired from playing sports, I intend to work in the cyber security industry. I would prefer to work in the private sector, rather than for the government period while in college, I have picked up a part-time job at the Iron County Humane Animal Shelter. I have always had a passion for animals, so saving the lives of various pets, and finding them a loving home has always been a pleasant experience for me!</p>
